mmapi

A python client library for the Multimap API. Uses Multimap's REST web service for the following services:

- Geocoding
- Routing
- Spatial Search (Where's my nearest?)

Quick example to get started:
------------------------------

from mmapi import MMAddress, MMGeocoder

geocoder = MMGeocoder( API_KEY )
address = MMAddress(qs='london', country_code='gb')
result = geocoder.geocode( address )

For further examples, see test.py

Planned enhancements
--------------------
* Support calling Multimap business grade services.
